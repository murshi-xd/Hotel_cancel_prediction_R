## Aim and Objectives

This project aims to:
1. Conduct an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand hotel booking datasets' characteristics, trends, and patterns.
2. Develop and employ machine learning models to predict the status of upcoming hotel reservations while considering cancellation-prone factors.
3. Provide a predictive model-based decision support system for data-driven booking management decisions.
4. Implement techniques to enhance booking management by offering tailored incentives to potential cancellations, thereby increasing booking retention.
5. Analyze booking trends to optimize resource allocation in hotels for efficient operations.

## Problem Statement

The hotel industry faces challenges in minimizing reservation cancellations, leading to revenue loss and inefficient resource utilization. The lack of a systematic approach to predict cancellations impedes the industry's ability to customize offers proactively and allocate resources effectively.

## Literature Review

The project leverages machine learning and EDA techniques to optimize hotel booking management. It aims to develop forecasting models for accurately predicting the probability of reservation cancellations, facilitating informed decision-making in booking strategies.

## Survey of R Packages for EDA

The project compares and evaluates three popular R packages for exploratory data analysis: DataExplorer, explore, and SmartEDA. Each package offers unique features and benefits tailored to different user preferences and project requirements.

## Case Study: Predictive Analysis for Hotel Booking Cancellations

The project's predictive analysis focuses on creating a robust prediction model for anticipating hotel reservation cancellations. By utilizing a large dataset and employing feature selection techniques, the project achieves high accuracy and reliability in cancellation predictions.

## Conclusions

The project provides actionable data-driven strategies for hotel booking management, including tailored offers, resource optimization, non-refundable booking strategies, and personalized marketing campaigns. These strategies aim to improve booking retention and operational efficiency in the hotel industry.
